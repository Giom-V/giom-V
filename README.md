## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey there, I'm **Giom** (aka Guillaume Vernade), a tech explorer who's gone from neural networks to Nest and back to AI, and from Paris to Quebec... and well, a bunch of places in between!

This isn't your typical coder story. My journey started in the world of academia, where I dove deep into neural networks *before* they were cool (talk about being ahead of the curve!). But the lure of the real world (and maybe a touch of loneliness in research) led me to the wild west of tech management, and a love for Agile philosophy.

I've been a part of Bouygues Telecom, the 4th largest telco in France, helped build digital experiences at Axa, one of the world's biggest insurance companies, and even dove into the immersive world of video games at Ubisoft, working on massive titles like Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Immortals. Oh, and I once helped ship over 30 games on Google Stadia (RIPðŸª¦).

Now, I'm thriving at Google, navigating the ever-evolving landscape of tech, from AI and video games to the home automation world of Nest. Currently, I'm wading through the amazing world of Gen AI with Deepmind Gemini DelRel (which means my job is to be your voice!). I'm fascinated by product visions that make an impact, and I'm always looking for new ways to bring teams together.

**Why all this info?** Because I'm a firm believer in transparency and collaboration. You'll see that reflected in my work. I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty with a quick-and-dirty prototype, and I love breaking down silos. I'm all about making things better for users.
